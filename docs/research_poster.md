# AI-Powered Resume Analysis and Job Matching System

## Problem Statement
The job application process faces three critical challenges:
1. **Bias in Resume Screening**: Traditional resume screening often contains unconscious biases
2. **ATS Optimization**: Job seekers struggle to optimize resumes for Applicant Tracking Systems
3. **Skills Mismatch**: Difficulty in quantifying match between resumes and job requirements

## Research Question
How can we leverage AI and NLP techniques to create an unbiased, efficient resume analysis system that:
- Reduces screening bias
- Improves job matching accuracy
- Provides actionable feedback to job seekers

## Methodology

### Data Processing Pipeline
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Resume Upload] --> B[Text Extraction]
    B --> C[Text Preprocessing]
    C --> D[Feature Extraction]
    D --> E[Analysis Pipeline]
    E --> F[Results Generation]
    
    subgraph Preprocessing
    B --> B1[PDF Parser]
    B --> B2[DOCX Parser]
    C --> C1[Text Cleaning]
    C --> C2[Structure Detection]
    end
    
    subgraph Analysis
    D --> D1[Keyword Extraction]
    D --> D2[Semantic Analysis]
    D --> D3[Bias Detection]
    end
```

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python 3.9+
- **ML Models**: Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- **Hardware Acceleration**: MPS (Metal Performance Shaders)
- **Processing**: PyPDF2, python-docx
- **Testing**: pytest with GitHub Actions CI/CD
