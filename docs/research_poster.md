# Resume Coach: AI-Powered Resume Analysis and Job Matching

## Abstract
This project implements a Resume Analysis and Generation (RAG) system that helps job seekers optimize their resumes and find better job matches. The system uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyze resumes, extract key information, and provide actionable feedback.

## Introduction
The job application process can be overwhelming, with job seekers often struggling to tailor their resumes effectively. This project addresses this challenge by providing automated resume analysis and recommendations.
