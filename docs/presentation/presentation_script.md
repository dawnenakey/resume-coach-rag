# Resume Coach RAG: AI-Powered Resume Analysis
## Presentation Script (8-10 minutes)

### Slide 1: Title (30 seconds)
"Hello everyone, I'm Dawnena Key, and today I'll be presenting my project 'Resume Coach RAG' - an AI-powered resume analysis and job matching system. This project combines modern AI techniques with real-world job market data to help job seekers optimize their resumes and understand their market position."

### Slide 2: Problem Statement (1 minute)
"The job application process today faces three critical challenges:
- First, traditional resume screening often contains unconscious biases, affecting both candidates and employers
- Second, job seekers struggle to optimize their resumes for Applicant Tracking Systems, or ATS
- And third, there's often a significant mismatch between candidate skills and job requirements

These challenges lead to qualified candidates being overlooked and prolonged job searches."

### Slide 3: Research Question & Goals (1 minute)
"My research focused on this question: How can we leverage AI and Natural Language Processing to create an unbiased, efficient resume analysis system?

Our goals were to:
- Reduce screening bias through objective analysis
- Improve job matching accuracy using modern NLP techniques
- Provide actionable feedback to job seekers

This approach aims to benefit both job seekers and employers by creating a more efficient and fair hiring process."

### Slide 4: Technical Architecture (1.5 minutes)
"The system architecture consists of three main components:
1. A FastAPI backend running on Python 3.9+
2. Advanced ML models using Sentence Transformers
3. Integration with the Adzuna API for real-time job market data

We've implemented hardware acceleration using MPS for efficient processing, and the entire system is containerized for easy deployment.

[Point to the architecture diagram]
As you can see, the system follows a modular design where each component handles a specific aspect of the analysis."

### Slide 5: Methodology (1.5 minutes)
"Our methodology follows a structured pipeline:
[Reference the sequence diagram]
1. Document Processing: We handle both PDF and DOCX formats
2. Text Extraction: Using specialized libraries for accurate content extraction
3. Analysis Pipeline: Including NLP processing, bias detection, and keyword analysis

The entire process is optimized to complete within seconds, as shown in our performance metrics."

### Slide 6: Results & Performance (1.5 minutes)
"Let me share our key results:
- Processing Speed: Complete analysis in under 3 seconds
- Accuracy Rate: 92% successful analysis rate
- Bias Detection: Quantifiable metrics for both technical and soft skills bias

[Point to performance charts]
As you can see from these metrics, we've achieved both speed and accuracy in our analysis."

### Slide 7: Key Features Demo (1.5 minutes)
"The system provides comprehensive insights:
- Technology stack analysis showing skill distribution
- Real-time job market demand data
- Salary insights based on current market trends
- Location-specific job market analysis

These features help users understand not just their resume's content, but its market position."

### Slide 8: Impact & Future Work (1 minute)
"The impact of this system includes:
- Reduced bias in initial resume screening
- Improved match rates between candidates and positions
- Faster application optimization process

Future enhancements will include:
- Industry-specific scoring
- Enhanced role-based recommendations
- Multilingual support"

### Slide 9: Conclusion & Q&A (30 seconds)
"To conclude, Resume Coach RAG demonstrates how AI can make job searching more efficient and equitable. The system is ready for deployment and shows promising results in real-world testing.

Thank you for your attention. I'm happy to take any questions."
